      <p><span class="cite">The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.</span><a class="citeOrigin" href="https://micro-frontends.org/">https://micro-frontends.org/</a></p>
      <p>This basic webshop is an attempt to use Micro Frontends as described by <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">micro-frontends.org</a>. The cart, the product highlights and the user service are independently developed and deployed Micro Frontends, sewed together by using the tools <a href="https://www.mosaic9.org/" target="_blank">Project Mosaic</a> provides.</p>
