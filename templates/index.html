      <h2>Wait, what is this?</h2>
      <p>"The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface." (<a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">https://micro-frontends.org/</a>)</p>
      <p>This basic webshop is an attempt to use Micro Frontends as described by <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">https://micro-frontends.org/</a>. The cart, the product highlights and the user service are independently developed and deployed Micro Frontends, composed together by Tailor.js during run- not compiletime.</p>
